                        When you use our data collection Website/Portal/URL, we collect and store your personal information which is provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our data collection Website/Portal/URL to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
                        In general, you can browse the data collection Website/Portal/URL without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the data collection Website/Portal/URL. We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our data collection Website/Portal/URL. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our users.

This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our data collection Website/Portal/URL or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address.
                        We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the data collection Website/Portal/URL to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the data collection Website/Portal/URL and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
                        Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the data collection Website/Portal/URL that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

                        If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback, we will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.
                        If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the data collection Website/Portal/URL, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
